    "# Multithreading in Python is a programming technique that allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread can execute its own sequence of instructions while sharing the same memory space and resources, enabling more efficient use of CPU time and improving the performance of I/O-bound applications.\n",
    "# Multithreading is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concurrency: It allows for concurrent execution of tasks, making applications more responsive. For example, in GUI applications, multithreading can keep the interface responsive while performing long-running tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "# I/O-bound Operations: In applications that perform a lot of I/O operations (like reading/writing files, making network requests, etc.), multithreading can help maximize resource usage. While one thread waits for I/O operations to complete, other threads can continue executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resource Sharing: Threads share the same memory space, making it easier to share data between them compared to separate processes, which have their own memory space.\n",
